Hangman for Windows!
 
Write a program that does the following: 
 
Use a String array to store some 5 letter words.  Keep it simple by making all words the same length, or challenge your UI skills by doing different length words!
Build a UI with a hangman image (use a PictureBox) and let the user try to guess the word by doing one of two things:  1) guess a letter or 2) guess the word itself.
You should use a set of Radio buttons and TextBoxes for the guessing part, along with a Button that does the guess.  Make sure you limit the TextBox for the single letter guess to 1 character.
Find a way to display the guessed letters to the user while keeping the missing letters hidden
Congratulate the user or inform them they have lost.  In either case, ask if they want to play again
Comment your code or lose points!
 
DO NOT CHEAT!  CODE SHOULD NOT BE IDENTICAL BETWEEN STUDENTS!
 
Submit your final Solution (ZIPPED) to the Portal.
 
Present your program to the class and explain your code.
 
NOTE:  You will need to do a lot of searching in the string array when the user guesses a letter and also string comparisons.  Don’t forget to use .ToLower() or .ToUpper before ==.
