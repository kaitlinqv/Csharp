Introduction to Windows Forms and Basic Controls (Label, TextBox, Button)

Create a new Windows Forms project and build a Login Screen (set the form’s name to Login).  You will need 3 labels, 2 textbox controls, and a button.  Be sure to set the control names for the textboxes and buttons as follows: userName, userPass, login.  Change the text of the button to “Login” as well.
 
Set the font for the entire Form to VERDANA.  Set all 3 labels to be bold.
 
The first 2 labels simply need to say “Username:” and “Password:” and are used to “prompt” the user as to what they need to enter into the textboxes that line up with each.
 
Now, the 3rd label will be dynamically modified.  Put this label below the button.  It will be used to show if the username/password is successful. Because we will need to access the label with code, we need to give it a better name than the default name generated by the designer.  Call this label loginMessage. 
 
Generate an EVENT by double-clicking the Submit button.  This will drop you into the code-behind.  An event is simply a function call.  Use a IF-ELSE IF-ELSE block in the event to check the username and password entered and display the appropriate message back in the loginMessage label.
 
NOTE:  You will simply hard-code the correct username and password in the code for now.  Be sure to have a message that says “Username is required” if the value of userName.Text is blank.  Do the same for userPass.
 
If the user enters the correct name/password, simply close out the form to exit the program.
