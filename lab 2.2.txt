More Controls: Checkbox, Radio, and ListBox
 
Create a new Windows Forms project and build a Screen with a Checkbox control and set its Text property = “Enable Controls”.   Add a Button control and set its Text = “Clear List”.
 
Add 3 Radio button controls.   These buttons work together to only allow 1 of the 3 to be “checked” at any given time.  Set the Text property of these buttons as follows:  “Banana”, “Apple” and “Orange”
 
Add a ListBox control and Label control (put the Label right above the ListBox).  Set the Text property of the Label control to “Your Fruits:”
 
Make 5 Events by clicking on the CheckBox, Button and each of the Radio buttons.  DO NOT add an Event for the ListBox!
 
In the code-behind, add logic to the CheckBox event so that, if it is checked (using the Checked property… this is a Boolean), set the Enabled property of ALL other controls to true.  Otherwise, set them all to false.  DO NOT change the Checkbox control’s property!
 
For each Radio button checked event, add to the ListBox the Text from the current Radio Button.
 
Finally, in the Button’s event, clear out the ListBox using the Clear() method.
 
Include comments in the code-behind!
